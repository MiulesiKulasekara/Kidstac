          examined the effectiveness of popular educational apps for
          preschoolers. This study found that while many apps are technically
          well-designed, most lack strong educational content and personalized
          interaction. Our project aims to address this gap by using advanced
          pose detection technology to offer real-time feedback during physical
          activities, providing a more interactive and engaging learning
          experience for young children.

          immediate feedback makes learning more engaging and suitable for
